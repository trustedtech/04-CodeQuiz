# 04-CodeQuiz
This app is a simple quiz that makes use of JavaScript and jQuery for the time and event-handling.  It took a substantial amount of research, trial and error, and determination to flesh-out all the functionalities involved, however it was worth the effort as it helped to solidify my understanding of crucial coding concepts.
